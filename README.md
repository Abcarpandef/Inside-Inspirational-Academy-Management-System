# Inside-Inspiration-Academy-Management-System
This is a Java-based desktop application project for the Inside Inspiration Academy management system. Here we used Java, AWT, Swing, and MySQL to complete the project.

Basic Requirements:

We used an ojdbc6 executable jar file and mysql-connector-java-8.0.30 initially to execute our project.

Note:

You have to first download a JDK on your device to execute all of these.
